## Overview
This is a pure HTML, CSS based project which helps you understand how to design a mobile friendly website and also using basic HTML tags etc.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Made this project view good on Desktop, Mobile. I need to still work for the tablet(iPad's) size.

## My process
I started with by adding HTML tags and div's to help in styling the page.
Then moved to the CSS part & I started as Desktop-first design.

Later added **Mobile Media Queries**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
Learnt how to use *FontFamily*, *Letter-spacing*, *Text Transform*, *using different images based on screen width* etc..


```html
<!-- HTML for displaying different images based on screen width-->
<picture>
                <source srcset="./assets/images/image-header-mobile.jpg" media="(max-width: 375px)">
                <source srcset="./assets/images/image-header-desktop.jpg">
                <img src="./assets/images/image-header-desktop.jpg" alt="talks" style="width:auto">
            </picture>
        </div>
```
```css
/* CSS to give image a TINTED effect*/
.image {
    float: right;
    margin-bottom: -5px;
    background-color: hsl(277, 73%, 32%);
    border: 0px solid;
}

img {
    opacity: 0.4;
}
}

/*CSS to set elements in same-line and use width to show in 2 lines
used for 10k+ COMPANIES, 314 TEMPLATES, 12M+ QUERIES.
*/
.one,
.two,
.three {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100px;
}
/* To make image and text part on same line */
.image,
.text {
    display: inline-block;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to modify and make this static page more responisve by adding on Tablet size for making the page more responsive.

Also will later learn js and try to implement in all of my static-page projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp) - This helped me for displaying different image based on screen width.
- [Letzcode](https://www.letzcode.in/HtmlCss/4_script.php) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally add the Image Tinting effect.
